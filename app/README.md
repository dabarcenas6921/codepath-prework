Submitted by: David Barcenas

Time spent: 1.5 hrs

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Implemented a diffuclty selector when start is pressed
* [x] Each difficulty has a different speed for the game.

## Reflection Questions

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

*   One of the major challenges I faced was actually learning how to use JavaScript in my code. I'm still somewhat new to web development and had really only touched on a bit of HTML and CSS in the past. Learning JavaScript for this project wasn't that difficult, however, because I had access to the internet and helpful resources. JavaScript is very similar to other languages I have used in the past so most of the syntax looks the same. I had to research a few things about JavaScript such as array mutability and specific math functions like Math.random to add changes to my code such as the random pattern feature. Another challenge I faced while creating this submission was learning how CSS works together with HTML to change the look of website elements. An example of this was when I created the difficulty pop-up in my game. Through the help of Youtube and other websites, I learned what the difference between "class" and "id" are in HTML and how to use them in CSS code. I then learned about a few CSS properties that I can use in my code to make my pop-up window look better. Overall, most of the challenges I faced in this project were dealt with by using online resources to guide me.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

*   After completing this submission, I have questions about more complicated features of web development. I know of the existence of different web development frameworks such as React and Angular but I want to learn how this project would look different with those features frameworks applied. I'm familiar with a few features of React such as components because I have tried to learn it in the past but I'm not sure what other improvements could be made to the code using those frameworks. I'm also curious about how to connect a database to web applications. I'm currently learning about database management at school but I'm curious about how to implemenet these features into my code. Perhaps I could use that feature for some fun extensions to this project like an online version of the game where players can enter their username and put their score on a leaderboard.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

*  The main thing I would do with my spare time is to add additional features to the game that I'm missing. There are a lot of good ideas on the "optional features" list and I plan on adding a few of them to the game in the future. It's always fun for me to add these new features because I end up learning a lot and they test my ability to think critically. Like I said in the previous question, I would love to add an online leaderboard to this game that could display player high scores. This would potentially need a database and the implementation of an "infinite" mode. Additionally, I was thinking of making an "Extreme" mode for the game where the player is given both a pattern to memorize while the squares are moving and bouncing off the screen. This would add a layer of difficulty to the game that would make it extremely difficult to win. Apart from these features, I would like to just polish the website and make it look nicer. The buttons and header could use a bit of work to stand out more. Maybe the background can have a picture to make it more interesting or I could implement some animations to the pop-up window. In general, a lot of the white space can be removed and the game could be centered in the middle of the screen.
